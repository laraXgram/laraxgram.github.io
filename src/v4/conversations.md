# Conversations

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

Many bots need to ask the user a series of questions — a registration flow, a support ticket, an order form — and remember every answer along the way. Wiring this up by hand with steps and cache keys quickly becomes messy.

LaraGram's **Conversation** component gives you a clean, declarative way to build these multi-step question-and-answer flows. You declare the questions, LaraGram sends them one by one, validates each reply, collects the answers, and hands them back to you when the flow completes. State is persisted automatically between updates, so a conversation survives across the many separate requests a webhook bot receives.

```php
use LaraGram\Support\Facades\Bot;

Bot::onText('start', function () {
    Conversation::start('Onboarding');
});
```

<a name="how-it-works"></a>
### How It Works

A conversation is intercepted by a global [middleware](/v4/middleware) that runs on every incoming update *before* your listens are matched. While a conversation is active for a chat, the middleware feeds each update into the current question, validates it, stores the answer, and moves to the next question. When there are no more questions the conversation completes and control returns to your normal listens.

Because only lightweight state is cached (the current question index, the collected answers, attempt counts and timestamps), your question closures are **never serialized**. The conversation file is simply re-required on each update to rebuild the questions. This keeps conversations safe even on long-running [Surge](/v4/surge) servers.

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

The conversation configuration file is located at `config/conversation.php`:

```php
return [
    // The cache store used to persist conversation state (null = default store).
    'store' => env('CONVERSATION_STORE'),

    // The directory where conversation files live (default: app/Conversations).
    'path' => app_path('Conversations'),

    // Cache key prefix and the maximum lifetime (seconds) of stored state.
    'prefix' => 'conversation',
    'lifetime' => 3600,

    // Fallback defaults used when a conversation does not declare its own.
    'max_attempts' => 3,
    'cancel_command' => null,
    'cancel_timeout' => null,
    'forget_after_complete' => true,
];
```

> [!NOTE]
> Conversation state is persisted through the [Cache](/v4/cache) component. On a webhook bot, set `store` to a shared driver such as `redis` so state is available across the separate processes each update spawns.

## Creating Conversations

<a name="generating-conversations"></a>
### Generating Conversations

Conversations live in `app/Conversations` and are generated with the `make:conversation` command:

```shell
php laragram make:conversation Onboarding
```

Like a migration, a conversation file returns an **anonymous class** extending `LaraGram\Conversation\Conversation`. The file name is the conversation's name — there is no namespace or class name to remember:

```php
<?php

use LaraGram\Conversation\AnswersBag;
use LaraGram\Conversation\Conversation as BaseConversation;
use LaraGram\Conversation\Questioner;
use LaraGram\Request\Request;
use LaraGram\Support\Facades\Conversation;

return new class extends BaseConversation
{
    /**
     * Declare the conversation's questions.
     */
    public function start(): void
    {
        Conversation::create(function (Questioner $questioner) {
            $questioner->ask('What is your name?')->name('name');

            $questioner->ask('How old are you?')
                ->name('age')
                ->validate('required|integer|min:1');
        });
    }

    /**
     * Handle the conversation completing.
     */
    public function onComplete(Request $request, AnswersBag $answers): void
    {
        $request->sendMessage(
            user()->id,
            "Welcome, {$answers->get('name')}!"
        );
    }

    /**
     * Handle the conversation being cancelled.
     */
    public function onCancel(Request $request, string $reason): void
    {
        //
    }
};
```

The `start` method is where you declare your questions. It is called every time the conversation's state is rebuilt, so keep it declarative — do not perform side effects there.

<a name="starting-conversations"></a>
### Starting Conversations

Start a conversation from any listen using the `Conversation` facade's `start` method, passing the conversation's name (its file name) and, optionally, an array of parameters:

```php
use LaraGram\Support\Facades\Bot;
use LaraGram\Support\Facades\Conversation;

Bot::onText('register', function () {
    Conversation::start('Onboarding');
});

// Pass parameters that are available to the conversation...
Conversation::start('Onboarding', ['plan' => 'pro']);
```

As a shortcut, you may register a listen that immediately starts a conversation with the `Bot::conversation` method. It accepts the listen pattern, the conversation name, the update verbs to match (default `TEXT`), and optional parameters:

```php
Bot::conversation('register', 'Onboarding');

Bot::conversation('register', 'Onboarding', 'TEXT', ['plan' => 'pro']);
```

<a name="asking-questions"></a>
## Asking Questions

Every question begins with `ask` and is customized with a fluent chain of methods. The prompt string is the only required argument:

```php
$questioner->ask('What is your email address?')
    ->name('email')
    ->validate('required|email');
```

<a name="naming-answers"></a>
### Naming Answers

Use `name` to choose the key the answer is stored under. If you omit `name`, the answer is keyed by its zero-based position among the questions:

```php
$questioner->ask('First?')->name('first');  // stored as "first"
$questioner->ask('Second?');                // stored as 1
$questioner->ask('Third?')->name('third');  // stored as "third"
```

<a name="validating-answers"></a>
### Validating Answers

Attach [validation rules](/v4/validation) to a question with `validate`. When an answer fails, the conversation re-asks the same question (up to the allowed number of attempts) and fires the `onInvalid` hook. You may pass custom messages as the second argument:

```php
$questioner->ask('How old are you?')
    ->name('age')
    ->validate('required|integer|between:1,120', [
        'integer' => 'Please send a number.',
    ]);
```

<a name="answer-types"></a>
### Expecting Specific Answer Types

By default a question expects text. Use `type` to expect a different kind of update — a photo, contact, location, and so on. Aliases such as `img`, `file`, `gps`, and `place` are supported:

```php
$questioner->ask('Send your profile photo')->name('avatar')->type('photo');

$questioner->ask('Share your location')->name('spot')->type('location');
```

<a name="keyboards"></a>
### Attaching Keyboards

Send a [keyboard](/v4/keyboards) with the prompt using the `keyboard` method. Combine it with a `callback` type to accept inline button presses:

```php
use LaraGram\Keyboard\Keyboard;

$questioner->ask('Choose a plan')
    ->name('plan')
    ->keyboard(
        Keyboard::make()->inlineKeyboard()
            ->row(fn ($row) => $row
                ->col('Free', 'plan:free')
                ->col('Pro', 'plan:pro')
            )
    );
```

<a name="media-prompts"></a>
### Media Prompts

A prompt itself can be media. The prompt text becomes the caption where the type supports one:

```php
$questioner->ask('Here is our welcome guide')->document('guide.pdf');

$questioner->ask('Scan this code')->photo($fileId);
```

Available media prompt methods: `photo`, `video`, `audio`, `voice`, `document`, `animation`, `videoNote`, and `sticker` (or `media($kind, $file)` for the generic form). Captions are not supported for `videoNote` and `sticker`.

<a name="custom-senders"></a>
### Custom Senders

For full control over how a prompt is delivered, use `askUsing`. The closure receives the request and is responsible for sending the prompt:

```php
$questioner->ask('Pick a color')
    ->name('color')
    ->askUsing(function (Request $request) {
        $request->sendMessage(user()->id, 'Pick a color', reply_markup: $markup);
    });
```

<a name="skipping-questions"></a>
### Skipping Questions

Allow the user to skip a question by declaring a `skipCommand`. When the user sends that command, the answer is stored as skipped and the `onSkip` hook fires:

```php
$questioner->ask('Add a bio (optional)')
    ->name('bio')
    ->skipCommand('/skip');
```

<a name="per-question-callbacks"></a>
### Per-Question Callbacks

Run logic immediately after a question is answered with `then`. The callback receives the request, the `Answer`, and the full `AnswersBag` collected so far. Pass `defer: true` (or chain `->defer()`) to run the callback at the end of the conversation instead:

```php
use LaraGram\Conversation\Answer;
use LaraGram\Conversation\AnswersBag;

$questioner->ask('What is your name?')
    ->name('name')
    ->then(function (Request $request, Answer $answer, AnswersBag $answers) {
        logger("Got name: {$answer->text()}");
    });
```

<a name="per-question-attempts"></a>
### Per-Question Attempts

Override the maximum invalid attempts for a single question with `attempts`:

```php
$questioner->ask('Enter the code')->name('code')->attempts(5);
```

<a name="working-with-answers"></a>
## Working With Answers

<a name="the-answers-bag"></a>
### The Answers Bag

When a conversation completes, `onComplete` receives an `AnswersBag` — a countable, iterable collection of `Answer` objects:

```php
public function onComplete(Request $request, AnswersBag $answers): void
{
    $name = $answers->get('name');       // the "name" Answer
    $all  = $answers->all();             // array of Answer objects
    $data = $answers->toArray();         // plain array of values

    if ($answers->has('bio')) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

You may also retrieve the current answers at any time via the facade:

```php
$answers = Conversation::answers();
```

<a name="the-answer-object"></a>
### The Answer Object

Each answer is a type-aware `Answer` object. It exposes helpers for reading the value according to its kind:

```php
$answer = $answers->get('avatar');

$answer->text();        // text of a text answer
$answer->data();        // callback data of an inline button press
$answer->file();        // FileBag for a media answer
$answer->media();       // the largest MediaFile for a media answer
$answer->download('avatars/user.jpg', 'public');

$answer->isText();
$answer->isCallback();
$answer->isMedia();
$answer->isSkipped();

(string) $answer;       // the text (or callback data) of the answer
```

Because `Answer` is `Stringable`, you can drop it straight into a message and it renders its text:

```php
$request->sendMessage(user()->id, "Hi {$answers->get('name')}!");
```

<a name="lifecycle-hooks"></a>
## Lifecycle Hooks

Override any of these methods on your conversation class to react to events during the flow:

<div class="overflow-auto">

| Hook | Fired when |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `onStart(Request $request)` | The conversation begins. |
| `onAsk(Request $request, Question $question)` | Right before a question is sent. |
| `onAnswer(Request $request, Question $question, Answer $answer)` | A question receives a valid answer. |
| `onSkip(Request $request, Question $question)` | A question is skipped via its skip command. |
| `onBack(Request $request, Question $question)` | The user goes back to the previous question. |
| `onInvalid(Request $request, Question $question, array $errors, int $attempt)` | An answer fails validation. |
| `onCancel(Request $request, string $reason)` | The conversation is cancelled. |
| `onComplete(Request $request, AnswersBag $answers)` | Every question has been answered. |

</div>

<a name="cancelling-conversations"></a>
## Cancelling Conversations

<a name="cancel-command"></a>
### Cancel Command

Declare a `cancelCommand` so the user can exit the flow at any point. When matched, the conversation is cancelled with the reason `"command"`:

```php
return new class extends BaseConversation
{
    public string $cancelCommand = '/cancel';

    // ...
};
```

<a name="cancel-timeout"></a>
### Timeout

Set `cancelTimeout` to automatically cancel a conversation after a period of inactivity (in seconds). The timeout is checked lazily on the next update; when exceeded, the conversation cancels with the reason `"timeout"` and the update passes through to your normal listens:

```php
public int $cancelTimeout = 300; // 5 minutes
```

<a name="cancelling-manually"></a>
### Cancelling Manually

Cancel the active conversation programmatically with the facade. The default reason is `"manual"`:

```php
Conversation::cancel();

Conversation::cancel('user_left');
```

The cancellation reasons passed to `onCancel` are: `command`, `timeout`, `max_attempts`, `interrupted`, and `manual`.

<a name="back-navigation"></a>
## Back Navigation

Users can step back to the previous question. Configure back navigation per question with `back` (or disable it with `noBack`):

```php
$questioner->ask('What is your name?')->name('name');

$questioner->ask('How old are you?')
    ->name('age')
    ->back(mode: 'inline', label: 'Back', callbackData: 'conversation:back');
```

The `mode` may be `reply`, `inline`, `command`, `text`, or `none`. The back control is automatically skipped on the first question.

To enable back navigation for the whole conversation, override the `back` method (or declare a `public ?Back $back` property). Per-question settings are merged field-by-field over the conversation-wide default:

```php
use LaraGram\Conversation\Back;

public function back(): ?Back
{
    return Back::make(mode: 'inline', label: 'Back');
}
```

When the user goes back, the previous answer is cleared, the `onBack` hook fires, and the question is re-asked.

<a name="priority"></a>
## Priority: Listens vs. Conversation

By default, your regular and [step](/v4/step) listens take precedence over an active conversation. If a listen matches an incoming update, that listen runs and the active conversation is **interrupted** (cancelled with the reason `"interrupted"`). This lets a user run a command like `/help` in the middle of a flow.

The full resolution order is:

```text
regular listen  >  step listen  >  conversation  >  bot fallback
```

To make a conversation (or a single question) handle the update *before* any listen, use the `Priority` enum. This prevents interruption for as long as that priority is in effect:

```php
use LaraGram\Conversation\Priority;

// For a single question...
$questioner->ask('Type the confirmation code')
    ->name('code')
    ->priority(Priority::Conversation);
```

```php
// For the whole conversation...
use LaraGram\Conversation\Priority;

public function priority(): ?Priority
{
    return Priority::Conversation;
}
```

The effective priority is resolved as: the current question's priority, falling back to the conversation's priority, falling back to `Priority::Listen`.

<a name="inline-conversations"></a>
## Inline Conversations

For quick flows you don't want to put in a dedicated file, build a conversation inline. `Conversation::inline` receives the same `Questioner` and returns a fluent builder — it starts automatically when the builder is discarded, or you may call `start` explicitly:

```php
use LaraGram\Conversation\Answer;
use LaraGram\Conversation\AnswersBag;
use LaraGram\Conversation\Questioner;
use LaraGram\Request\Request;
use LaraGram\Support\Facades\Conversation;

Bot::onText('feedback', function () {
    Conversation::inline(function (Questioner $q) {
        $q->ask('What went wrong?')->name('issue');
        $q->ask('How can we reach you?')->name('contact');
    })
    ->maxAttempts(2)
    ->cancelCommand('/cancel')
    ->onComplete(function (Request $request, AnswersBag $answers) {
        $request->sendMessage(user()->id, 'Thanks for your feedback!');
    })
    ->start();
});
```

For a single-question flow, `Conversation::ask` is even shorter:

```php
Conversation::ask('What is your name?', 'name')
    ->onComplete(function (Request $request, AnswersBag $answers) {
        $request->sendMessage(user()->id, "Hi {$answers->get('name')}!");
    });
```

The inline builder offers the same settings as a file conversation: `maxAttempts`, `cancelTimeout`, `cancelCommand`, `forgetAfterComplete`, `back`, `noBack`, `priority`, `name`, `with` (parameters), and the `onInvalid`, `onCancel`, and `onComplete` hooks.

> [!NOTE]
> Inline conversations serialize their closures to persist across updates, so any variables captured with `use` (or `$this`) must be serializable.

<a name="events"></a>
## Events

LaraGram dispatches [events](/v4/events) throughout a conversation's lifecycle. You may listen for any of them:

<div class="overflow-auto">

| Event |
| ----- |
| `LaraGram\Conversation\Events\ConversationStarted` |
| `LaraGram\Conversation\Events\QuestionAsked` |
| `LaraGram\Conversation\Events\AnswerReceived` |
| `LaraGram\Conversation\Events\AnswerInvalid` |
| `LaraGram\Conversation\Events\QuestionSkipped` |
| `LaraGram\Conversation\Events\BackRequested` |
| `LaraGram\Conversation\Events\ConversationCancelled` |
| `LaraGram\Conversation\Events\ConversationCompleted` |

</div>

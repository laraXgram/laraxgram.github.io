Application development is no different. When you understand how your development tools function, you feel more comfortable and confident using them.</p><p>The goal of this document is to give you a good, high-level overview of how the LaraGram framework works. By getting to know the overall framework better, everything feels less &quot;magical&quot; and you will be more confident building your applications. If you don&#39;t understand all of the terms right away, don&#39;t lose heart! Just try to get a basic grasp of what is going on, and your knowledge will grow as you explore other sections of the documentation.</p><p><a name="lifecycle-overview"></a></p><h2 id="lifecycle-overview" tabindex="-1">Lifecycle Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#lifecycle-overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Lifecycle Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a name="first-steps"></a></p><h3 id="first-steps" tabindex="-1">First Steps <a class="header-anchor" href="#first-steps" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;First Steps&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The entry point for all requests to a LaraGram application is the <code>public/index.php</code> file. All requests are directed to this file by your web server (Apache / Nginx) configuration. The <code>index.php</code> file doesn&#39;t contain much code. Rather, it is a starting point for loading the rest of the framework.</p><p>The <code>index.php</code> file loads the Composer generated autoloader definition, and then retrieves an instance of the LaraGram application from <code>bootstrap/app.php</code>. The first action taken by LaraGram itself is to create an instance of the application / <a href="/container.html">service container</a>.</p><p><a name="http-console-kernels"></a></p><h3 id="bot-console-kernels" tabindex="-1">Bot / Console Kernels <a class="header-anchor" href="#bot-console-kernels" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bot / Console Kernels&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Next, the incoming request is sent to either the Bot kernel or the console kernel, using the <code>handleRequest</code> or <code>handleCommand</code> methods of the application instance, depending on the type of request entering the application. These two kernels serve as the central location through which all requests flow. For now, let&#39;s just focus on the Bot kernel, which is an instance of <code>LaraGram\\Foundation\\Bot\\Kernel</code>.</p><p>The Bot kernel defines an array of <code>bootstrappers</code> that will be run before the request is executed. These bootstrappers configure error handling, configure logging, <a href="/configuration.html#environment-configuration">detect the application environment</a>, and perform other tasks that need to be done before the request is actually handled. Typically, these classes handle internal LaraGram configuration that you do not need to worry about.</p><p>The Bot kernel is also responsible for passing the request through the application&#39;s middleware stack. We&#39;ll talk more about these soon.</p><p>The method signature for the Bot kernel&#39;s <code>handle</code> method is quite simple: it receives a <code>Request</code> and returns a <code>Response</code>. Think of the kernel as being a big black box that represents your entire application. Feed it Bot requests and it will return Bot responses.</p><p><a name="service-providers"></a></p><h3 id="service-providers" tabindex="-1">Service Providers <a class="header-anchor" href="#service-providers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Service Providers&quot;">​</a></h3><p>One of the most important kernel bootstrapping actions is loading the <a href="/providers.html">service providers</a> for your application. Service providers are responsible for bootstrapping all of the framework&#39;s various components, such as the database, queue, validation, and listening components.</p><p>LaraGram will iterate through this list of providers and instantiate each of them. After instantiating the providers, the <code>register</code> method will be called on all of the providers. Then, once all of the providers have been registered, the <code>boot</code> method will be called on each provider. This is so service providers may depend on every container binding being registered and available by the time their <code>boot</code> method is executed.</p><p>Essentially every major feature offered by LaraGram is bootstrapped and configured by a service provider. Since they bootstrap and configure so many features offered by the framework, service providers are the most important aspect of the entire LaraGram bootstrap process.</p><p>While the framework internally uses dozens of service providers, you also have the option to create your own. You can find a list of the user-defined or third-party service providers that your application is using in the <code>bootstrap/providers.php</code> file.</p><p><a name="listening"></a></p><h3 id="listening" tabindex="-1">Listening <a class="header-anchor" href="#listening" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Listening&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Once the application has been bootstrapped and all service providers have been registered, the <code>Request</code> will be handed off to the listener for dispatching. The listener will dispatch the request to a listen or controller, as well as run any listen specific middleware.</p><p>Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for filtering or examining Bot requests entering your application. For example, LaraGram includes a middleware that verifies if the user of your application is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware block the request. However, if the user is authenticated, the middleware will allow the request to proceed further into the application. Some middleware are assigned to all listens within the application, while some are only assigned to specific listens or listen groups. You can learn more about middleware by reading the complete <a href="/middleware.md.html">middleware documentation</a>.</p><p>If the request passes through all of the matched listen&#39;s assigned middleware, the listen or controller method will be executed and the response returned by the listen or controller method will be sent back through the listen&#39;s chain of middleware.</p><p><a name="finishing-up"></a></p><h3 id="finishing-up" tabindex="-1">Finishing Up <a class="header-anchor" href="#finishing-up" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Finishing Up&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Once the listen or controller method returns a response, the response will travel back outward through the listen&#39;s middleware, giving the application a chance to modify or examine the outgoing response.</p><p>Finally, once the response travels back through the middleware, the Bot kernel&#39;s <code>handle</code> method returns the response object to the <code>handleRequest</code> of the application instance, and this method calls the <code>send</code> method on the returned response. We&#39;ve now completed our journey through the entire LaraGram request lifecycle!</p><p><a name="focus-on-service-providers"></a></p><h2 id="focus-on-service-providers" tabindex="-1">Focus on Service Providers <a class="header-anchor" href="#focus-on-service-providers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Focus on Service Providers&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Service providers are truly the key to bootstrapping a LaraGram application. The application instance is created, the service providers are registered, and the request is handed to the bootstrapped application. It&#39;s really that simple!</p><p>Having a firm grasp of how a LaraGram application is built and bootstrapped via service providers is very valuable. Your application&#39;s user-defined service providers are stored in the <code>app/Providers</code> directory.</p><p>By default, the <code>AppServiceProvider</code> is fairly empty. This provider is a great place to add your application&#39;s own bootstrapping and service container bindings. For large applications, you may wish to create several service providers, each with more granular bootstrapping for specific services used by your application.</p>',38)]))}const f=o(a,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
